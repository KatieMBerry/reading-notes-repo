 - definition lists: for a series of terms and their defs
    - def list tags = "dl"
    - terms tags = "dt"
    - def tag = "dd"
- box dimensions:
    - use % = box is relative to the size of the browser or box around it
    - use ems = size of box depends on size of text within
- min-width - the smallest the box can get
- max-width - how wide it can be displayed
- min-height & max-height - to control height of box
    - overflow: hidden or scroll (for when contents of box spill over)
- centering content:
    - first set a width for the box otherwise will take-up width of page

//// JS ////
Arrays: for lists or a set of values that are related to each other
    - good for when you don't know the number of items the list will contain

- Switch statements: starts w/ variable "switch value"; each case indicates a possible value and the code to be executed if the variable matches that value
    - a default option is run if no other cases match
    - if a match is found no other code is ran
-falsy = 0 / truthy = 1
    - presence of object or array = truthy (used to check for existence on a page)
- Loops: check a condition and if returns true, will execute code and will keep going until returns false
    - For loop = for a specific number of times => initialization; condition update: for (i = 0;i < 10>; i++)
    - While loop = if number of times is unknown
    - Do While loop = runs at least once, even if false the first time
    - Keyowrds: 
        - break
        - continue
